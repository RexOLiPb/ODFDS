# ODFDS

Problem statement â€“ A new bay area food delivery service, ODFDS, has begun to serve Santa Clara County.  The business will allow restaurants to request delivery of their take-out orders.  ODFDS will match the nearest available driver to the restaurant and dispatch him/her for pickup and delivery.  ODFDS needs a system for sub-contracted drivers to locate their next request for the food delivery.  Require mapping, time based traffic events, and location based searches to guarantee the wait time to < 40 minutes from the time of request.
